    "We've all heared the expression \"it's such a small world\". You often have unnexpected connection with someone you just meet with whom you have a friend or a relative in common, which just feels like an incredible coincidence. Watts and Strogatzs try to quantify just that. \n",

    "In the paper, the authors show that some networked systems showcase what they call \"small-worlds\" features. These involve a short path length and high clustering coefficient. In plain terms, what this means is that some systems have their components very well connected to their close neighbours while not too far from distant ones."
